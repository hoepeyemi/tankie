## How to Play

1. Open any **Blast Tanks** post in `r/tankie3d_dev` and tap **Play** on the animated preview.
2. On first launch, choose a **display name** and pick a **tank skin**.
3. You land on the **Quick Play** tab — tap **⚡ Play Now** to drop straight into a match against AI bots. No wait, no setup.
4. **Drive**: WASD / left joystick (mobile)
5. **Aim turret**: Mouse move / right-swipe (mobile)
6. **Fire**: Left-click / Space / fire button (mobile)
7. **Honk**: K
8. Survive 3 minutes, rack up kills, and earn XP. The scoreboard appears automatically when the match ends.

### Multiplayer
1. Go to the **Multiplayer** tab and tap **Host**.
2. Share the 6-character room code with your opponent via comments or DM.
3. Your opponent opens the same post, goes to **Multiplayer → Join**, and enters the code.
4. Both players tap **Play** to start.

### XP Wager
1. Go to the **Wager** tab and set an XP amount.
2. Host a lobby — your XP is held in escrow.
3. Your opponent joins and their XP is deducted too.
4. Winner takes **2×** the wagered XP. Loser gets nothing. If the match can't complete, both players are refunded.

### Daily Challenge
Check the Quick Play tab for today's challenge (e.g. "Get 10 kills", "Survive 2 minutes"). Complete it for bonus XP on top of your match earnings.

## Gameplay Modes

### Quick Play
Drop instantly into an offline arena against 4 AI bot opponents (Shadow, Reaper, Maverick, Ghost, Titan). No setup, no wait — earn XP the moment you tap Play.

### Free Multiplayer
Host a lobby, share the 6-character room code with an opponent (via comments or DM), and battle live. Supports up to 6 players.

### XP Wager
Attach an XP wager to your multiplayer lobby. XP is held in server-side escrow on match creation/join and paid to the winner (2× the wager). If a match can't be settled (e.g. host disconnects), both players are refunded automatically.

### Daily Challenge
A daily challenge variant (7 deterministic types, seeded by date) gives bonus XP for completing specific objectives — kills, survival time, wager wins, match count, and more. No scheduler required; the challenge is derived server-side from the current UTC date.

## Progression System

| Rank | XP Required |
|------|-------------|
| Recruit | 0 |
| Private | 500 |
| Corporal | 1,500 |
| Sergeant | 3,500 |
| Lieutenant | 7,500 |
| Captain | 15,000 |
| Colonel | 22,500 |
| General | 30,000 |

Ranking up triggers a Reddit flair update (`reddit.setUserFlair`) and a community announcement comment (`reddit.submitComment`).

### Day Streak
Playing on consecutive days builds a streak (tracked via Redis TTL keys). Streak XP bonuses reward daily retention.

### XP Sources
- **Kill**: +25 XP
- **Win**: +100 XP
- **Daily challenge bonus**: varies by challenge type
- **Wager win**: 2× the wagered XP

## Tank Skins (Reddit Gold Purchases)

Paid skins are unlocked via Reddit's native payments system (`@devvit/payments`). SKUs are defined in `devvit.json`.

| SKU | Display Name | Price |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| `skin_military` | Soldier Boy Tank | 5 Gold |
| `skin_studystorm` | StudyStorm Tank | 25 Gold |
| `skin_weeb` | Weeb Kawaii Tank | 50 Gold |
| `skin_thomas` | Thomas The Tank | 100 Gold |

Each tank type has a `url` (flat UV texture map used by the renderer) and an `avatar` (pre-rendered cropped preview image used in the UI).

---

## Architecture

### Platform
- **Devvit 0.13.8** web-first architecture
- Two HTML entrypoints: `splash.html` (inline post preview) + `game.html` (expanded fullscreen)
- Server runs on `@devvit/web/server` with Hono routing

### Frontend
- **React** + **React Router** (`MemoryRouter`) for SPA navigation inside the Devvit iframe
- **Zustand** stores: `useNetwork`, `usePlayerSettings`, `useAudio`, `useMatchStore`
- **Three.js** + **Enable3d** (Ammo.js physics) for the 3D game engine
- **Framer Motion** for UI animations
- **TailwindCSS** for styling

### Networking
- `OfflineNetwork` — Quick Play local mode; spawns 4 `TankBot` AI opponents
- `DevvitNetwork` — real multiplayer via `/api/game/*` server endpoints + Devvit Realtime pub/sub channel

### Server
- **Redis** for all persistent state: player XP, streaks, leaderboard sorted set (`lb:xp`), wager escrow, rate-limit counters
- **Rate limiting** on score submit (1 per 3 min), wager actions (5 per min), challenge progress (20 per min)
- All XP mutations sync both `player:${username}` hash and `lb:xp` sorted set to keep leaderboard consistent

### AI Bots (`TankBot`)
- Finds closest enemy every 500 ms, aims turret, fires when angle diff < 0.2 rad and distance < 50 units
- Drives toward target, reverses if stuck, auto-rights when flipped, teleports if it falls out of bounds

### Mobile Controls (`VirtualGamepad`)
- Left joystick: WASD synthetic keyboard events
- Right swipe: `MouseEvent` movementX/Y for turret rotation
- Fire button (Space), Honk (K)
- Multi-touch tracked by `identifier`

## Changelog

### v0.0.45 — 2026-07-15
- Renamed app display to **Blast Tanks** throughout all UI, titles, and server-generated text
- Fixed lobby screen: added back button that cancels any active XP wager and disconnects cleanly
- Fixed lobby screen: peer cards now show the rendered tank avatar image instead of the raw texture map
- Fixed clipboard copy: now copies just the room code (not a broken Reddit iframe URL)
- Fixed Quick Play: navigates directly to the game after `quickPlay()` resolves (eliminated second-click friction)
- Fixed wager leaderboard desync: create/join/cancel/settle all now sync `lb:xp` sorted set alongside player hash
- Fixed wager settle failure: added cancel fallback in `GameOver.tsx` so XP is never permanently locked
- Fixed leaderboard mobile overflow: wrapped table in `overflow-x: auto` scroll container
- Fixed `submitCustomPost` missing `subredditName`: now passes `context.subredditName` explicitly
- Removed unused `context` import from `splash.ts`
- Updated README with How to Play, architecture overview, project structure, and Devvit API reference
